This is a simple NestJS project with two libraries and five basic APIs. The libraries encapsulate all possible responses, including error and success messages, that can occur in the application. By using this library, you ensure that your frontend teammates have access to all potential response types, streamlining the integration process. 

To use it, simply import the library in your code and add any custom error types to the documentation as needed (common errors are already included).


## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

## See Interace 
Once the application is running you can visit http://localhost:${YOUR_PORT}/swagger/api/document#/ to see the Swagger interface.
